ro-str-viewer
=============

Small library for reading and rendering effect files (`.str`) from Ragnarok Online MMORPG.
It contains also a small tool `com.skardach.ro.tools.STRViewer` that will allow you to read a given `.str` file and animate it.

This is a crude try by a guy who has little experience with Computer Graphics, let alone GLSL so be kind :wink:.
